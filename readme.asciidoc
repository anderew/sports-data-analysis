== Goals

=== First Step

==== Functionality
* Download my strava routes as polylines
* Combine polylines into a single, longer polyline
* Call an API to get the elevation at each polyline point
* Integrate polyline with waypoints data (taken from some other input)
* Output a csv with distance, waypoints, elevations
* Strech goal - draw the graph of above data

==== Technology
* Java (SpringBoot) initially
* Would like to experiment with NodeJs / Typescript
* Ideally end up with a microservice constelation

==== Running TODO

* How to handle breaks between activities?
* How to determine distance points?

Using equation below, can determine the distance between points.
That can give cummlative distance.
Thats enough for basic output.
To add waypoints
    - add API which allows waypoints to be entered as GPS coordinates
    - then have to find that point on our graph (or closest point)
    - tricky!
    - have to consider routes may not be acyclic so waypoint might not be first time route is crossed
    - could allow GPS coord plus approx distance
Might need to draw own graph, not sure how Excel/Sheets would handle

 double lat_1 = 18.457793 * (Math.PI / 180);
        double lon_1 = 73.3951930277778 *(Math.PI/180);
        double alt_1 = 270.146;

        double lat_2 = 18.4581253333333 * (Math.PI / 180);
        double lon_2 = 73.3963755277778 * (Math.PI / 180);
        double alt_2 = 317.473;

        const Double r = 6376.5 *1000;//redius of earth in meaters

        double x_1 = r * Math.Sin(lon_1) * Math.Cos(lat_1);
        double y_1 = r * Math.Sin(lon_1) * Math.Sin(lat_1);
        double z_1 = r * Math.Cos(lon_1);

        double x_2 = r * Math.Sin(lon_2) * Math.Cos(lat_2);
        double y_2 = r * Math.Sin(lon_2) * Math.Sin(lat_2);
        double z_2 = r * Math.Cos(lon_2);

        double dist = Math.Sqrt((x_2 - x_1) * (x_2 - x_1) + (y_2 - y_1) *
                                (y_2 - y_1) + (z_2 - z_1) * (z_2 - z_1));


                                x = alt * cos(lat) * sin(long)
                                y = alt * sin(lat)
                                z = alt * cos(lat) * cos(long)

        Do I have to start thinking about persistence?
