== Goals

=== First Step

==== Functionality
* Download my strava routes as polylines
* Combine polylines into a single, longer polyline
* Call an API to get the elevation at each polyline point
* Integrate polyline with waypoints data (taken from some other input)
* Output a csv with distance, waypoints, elevations
* Strech goal - draw the graph of above data

==== Technology
* Java (SpringBoot) initially
* Would like to experiment with NodeJs / Typescript
* Ideally end up with a microservice constelation

==== Running TODO

- Encrypt secret using jasypt before putting into git repo
- put into github repo!
- Rather than expose native activity, just expose what I want to see
- write some tests using JUnit5!
